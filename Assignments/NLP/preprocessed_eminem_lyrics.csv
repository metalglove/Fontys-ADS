crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are having a rough time period heres

the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintaining this shit ai not that hard that hard everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since mcs get taken to school with this music because i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i am a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey

of keeping up with the same pace looking boy because i am beginning to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod the way i am racing around the track call me nascar nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planets kryptonno asgard asgard so you will be thor i will be odin you rodent i am omnipotent let off then i am reloading immediately with these bombs i am toting and i should not be woken i am the walking dead but i am just a talking head a zombie floating but i got your mom deepthroating i am out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common poodle i am a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it is me my honestys brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case because even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i am back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ai not as big as i was but i am morphing into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad because fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad singing to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a twentyfour seven special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i ama kill you lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed uh summalumma doomalumma you assuming i am a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and i am devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they will be celebrating because i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he is too mainstream well that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it is not hiphop it is popbecause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it is curtains i am inadvertently hurting you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself because i make me do what i put my mind to and i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it is still tongueincheek fuck you i am drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i ama sleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i cannot batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,https://images.genius.com/058e2359838c93395c36119b48a2eff6.1000x1000x1.png

about to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds but if you are looking to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but yall are acting like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but saying i no longer got it because you missed a line and never caught it because it went over your head because you are too stupid to get it because you are mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you will never be an artist and i am harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i will never be is flawless all i will ever be is honest  illa illa illa  even when i am gone they are gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fucking alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i could not bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i ama hit my bottom if i do not pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i do not see why yall even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i do not cease fire until at least all are deceased i am east side never be caught slipping now you see why i do not sleep not even a wink i do not blink i do not doze off i do not even nod to the beats i do not even close my fucking eyes when i sneeze aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage the thing ai not even orangeoh my god that is a reach shout to all my colorblind people each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green aquamarine or you think water is pink dawg that is a date looks like an olive to me look there is an apple no it is not it is a peach so fingerbang pootie tang burger king gucci gang dookie dang charlamagne gonna hate anyway does not matter what i say give me donkey of the day what a way for 2018 to get underway but i am gonna say everything that i wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch invite em in like a one a day i am not done because i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it because the way i see people turnings making it seem worthless it is starting to defeat the purpose i am watching my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just trying to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined because i am determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i would at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he is deserted but i think it is working these verses are making him a wee bit nervous and he is too scurred to answer me with words because he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he is heard it because agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurting him or ask if i am linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis because they have been panning my album to death so i have been giving the media fingers do not wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they have been putting me through the ringer so i ai not ironing shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners,https://images.genius.com/4a9ce06a1f463b0c24c98c1870d4566f.1000x1000x1.png

perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it is hopeless i am the denial that you are hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it is over here we go all over again backs to the wall i am stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i am talking a lot of shit but i am backing it all up but in my head there is a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i am the ringing in your ears i am the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i am your time that is almost up that you have not acknowledged grab for some water but i am that pill that is too jagged to swallow i am the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stangs just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it is gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i am the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i am the future that is here to show you what happens tomorrow if you do not stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cannot call it quits when it is time to walk away i am every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there is anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then do not bother so fore you rest your case better make sure you are packing a wallop so one last time i am back fore it fades into black and it is all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left

Untouchable,Revival,2017-12-08,pt i hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you will not loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through black boy black boy we ai not gonna lie to you black boy black boy we do not like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down profile then we wonder why we see this side of you probably coming from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you are hiding that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it is back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we would be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep telling myself keep doing like you are doing no matter how many lives you ruin it is for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no ones ever indicted you why because you are a white boy white boy you are a rockstar my momma talking to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i do not listen to her because my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you are untouchable the worlds coming to an end i do not even care nobody can tell me shit because i am a big rockstar black boy black boy we do not get your culture and we do not care what our governments done to fuck you over man do not tell us your attitudes a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we about to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you do not have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we are fighting a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that is what we call em pigsties for they are like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we are stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it is like we are drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky because this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it is been embarrassing to be a white boy white boy you are a rockstar my momma talking to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i do not listen to her because my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you are untouchable the worlds coming to an end i do not even care nobody can tell me shit because i am a big rockstar pt ii seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life cannot escape this circumstance i would rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it is better disguised banter but that is life strapped because we are strapped financially and cannot find answers we are applying but mcdonalds seems to be the only franchise that will hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that is why it is at a stalemate and cannot arrive at a compromise so it is black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sending white cops in the black neighborhoods who ai not acclimated to em like that is the way to do it who seen some fucking videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that is racism the fear that a black face gives em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods because america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight would us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every days another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it is like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it is more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator do not gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers because no one oversees these cops and all we see is em beat charges we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we do not need all you crooked police officers peace offerings just keep marching until we reach congress but they are gonna say you are trying to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you do not stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you will be made to feel like a traitor we will treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singing this starspangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build,https://images.genius.com/ad4d90a9693cc80e5003187b422ffdde.1000x1000x1.png

Kings Never Die,Southpaw (Music From And Inspired by the Motion Picture),2015-07-10,here to stay even when i am gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die i can hear the drummer drumming and the trumpets someones tryna summon someone i know somethings coming but i am running from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it was not what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothing get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i am selling my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfucking cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons did not think i would be back did ya how about that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is something i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it is a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are counting me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i am not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept going i am tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause you are moving onto the next but is your respect gone cause someone told me that kings never die do not give me that sob story liar do not preach to the choir you ai not never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer would not even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it would actually have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i have been upstaged why am i online it is driving me crazy i am riding shotgun tryna get a gauge on what is hot but i am not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someones gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i am in a cage they so want a champion to fall it is no wonder why i laugh at em cause why cannot we win em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my backs against the wall and i am under attack again that i will act as if i am posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me coming back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just do not mean jack anymore if i am here today and gone tomorrow and i am not gonna be here to stay even when i am gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die i want it i am coming to get it so you son of a bitches do not duck youre gonna get riddick bowed critics will end up in critical think your shit is dope all you are gonna get is smoked and i ai not stopping until i am on top again all alone and on a throne like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode i have been owed tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard it broke my collarbone and when it is my time to go i am still not leaving stop for no one i do not know but i have been told an obstacle that blocks your road ya knock it over time to go for the pot of gold cause they say kings never die just ask jam master jay they just grow wings and they fly so hands up reach for the sky try to hold on and prolong these moments cause in a blink of an eye they will be over so you are tryna secure your legacy like shakur and ensure nobodys ever gonna be what you were so before you are leaving this earth you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk deacon of words syllable genius at work plus i am thinking that they are mistaking my kindness for weakness kill em with meanness i went from powdered milk and farina to flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts at gilberts to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers i made it to the silverscreen but rockys still what the theme is khalil on the beat cause making the beat aint the same feeling to me as killing the beat is or fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is it is that soundbombing thirstin howl common underground diamond d outsidaz stomach growl throbbing hunger outrhyming everyone god just give me one shot i swear that i will not let you down i ama be around foreverandaday even in the ground you ai not never ever gonna hear em say i ai not here to stay even when i am gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die kings never

Asshole,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe),2013-11-05,came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfilling but do not think i ever stopped to think that i was speaking to children everything was happening so fast it was like i blinkedsold three million then it all went blank all i remember is feeling ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feeling like i am always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling women dishing but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him guess i am a little bit of a hypocrite when i am ripping shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it is just my opinion if it contradicts how i am living put a dick in your rear end that is why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i am flattered you thought i was that important but you cannot ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i would just zone out good luck trying to convince a blonde it is like telling gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyones mind one day i would go down in history think they know now because everybody knows everybody knows that you are just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so do not pretend to be nice there is no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows thanks for the support asshole scratch thanks for the support asshole quit acting salty i was counting on you to count me out ask asher roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out thought i was history well goddamn honky that compliments like backhanding a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth nah i am off him but what the fucks all this

off me to take my beltword to pacquiao momma said there ai not nothing else to talk about better go in that ring and knock em out or you better not come out it is poetry in motion like freddie roach when he is quoting shakespeare so what if insults are revolting even helen keller knows life stinks you think it is a joke until you are bulletriddled but you should give little shit what i think this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman who needs to test a testicles not that man half of you do not got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo my souls escaping through this asshole that is gaping a black hole and i am swallowing this track whole better pack toilet paper but i am taking no crap ho here i go down the bat pole and i am changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreating cause everybody knows everybody knows that you are just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so do not pretend to be nice there is no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows holy mackerel i am the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull for thinking

words so you can understandable it is tragical thinking some magical shit is gonna happen that ai not practical you cracking a joke it is laughable cause me and loves like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it is safe to say i am uncrackable my heart is truly guarded full body armor bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you are special you are retarded

you was a minor been tryna hunt me down like a dog cause you are on my ass but you cannot get a cent cause all of my spare time is spent on my nose in this binder so do not bother trying only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i am a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line it is apparent i should not have been a parent i will never grow up so to hell with your parents and motherfuck father time it ai not never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime so even if i am halfdead i

of me i am right in your ass foot up it i stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school you ai not had to have no money or go shopping just to cop a fucking attitude now my doughs amounting to a mountain that is rised too high to count it never asked to be rich all i did was wish i had a dime for every time that i was doubted but then i think about it then i am enraged because i just figured out that if i was paid for the time i spent to put the pen to the page it would be minimum wage but it is embedded in my head i never hunted for the bread and butter what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but i am never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood i put up in the pen and when i am dead i wonder will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible i guess i better go harder than ever because i will never get another motherfucking opportunity again to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can chorus eminem  kent jones  because nobody likes me everybody hates me they want me to go eat some worms  i hope you offended  and drag my name through the mud through the dirt but i ama make you eat your words  i hope you offended  you can try to hold me down but you better let me up because you are only gonna make things worse  i hope you offended  because i swear when i get up i am never gonna let

that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road you gotta live it to feel it you did not you would not get it or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is to be walking this borderline of detroit city limits it is different it is a certain significance a certificate of authenticity you would never even see but it is everything to me it is my credibility you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc who is incredible upon the same pedestal as me but yet i am still unsigned having a rough time sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go who must i show to bust my flow where must i go who must i know or am i just another crab in the bucket cause i ai not having no luck with this little rabbit is foot fuck it maybe i need a new outlet i am starting to doubt shit i am feeling a little skeptical who i hang out with i look like a bum yo my clothes ai not about shit at the salvation army tryna salvage an outfit and it is cold tryna travel this road plus i feel like i am always stuck in this battling mode my defenses are so up but one thing i do not want is pity from no one this city is no fun there is no sun and it is so dark sometimes i feel like i am just being pulled apart from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends it is enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not what i am doing i just blow my head is a stove top i just explode the kettle gets so hot sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that i do not got but i have learned it is time for me to uturn yo it only takes one time for me to get burned ai not no falling no next time i meet a new girl i can no longer play stupid or be immature i got every ingredient all i need is the courage like i already got the beat all i need is the words got the urge suddenly it is a surge suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred time to show these free world leaders the three and a third i am no longer scared now i am free as a bird then i turn and cross over the median curb hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road i am a man gotta make a new plan time for me to just stand up and travel new land time for me to just take matters into my own hands once i am over these tracks man i ama never look back and i am gone i know right where i am going sorry momma i am grown i must travel alone ai not gong follow no footsteps i am making my own only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile

charter whose life could be harder widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart i am slightly retarded but tonight i am starting shit i am feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit on some mike tyson and pac shit looking to box with anybody disorderly conduct i will fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith fan of the lox bananas manic i am going in shock frantic i am trapped in a closet panic attack because i am claustrophobic no faggot i mean i cannot maneuver for movement because i have no room for improvement i am practically squashed compacted and boxed in toxic cans of arsenic flammable bars examine the content bar exam start of insanity charles hamilton slash manson and bronson animal snarls cannibal jaws shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter looking skantless as hannibals stalking anthony hopkins with his hands in his pockets black out zach galifianakis gallons of vodka but that gal has some knockers i betcha they ring a bell when i come back and i am conscious what happened doc i passed out again alcohols making me break into vacants naked stolen magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a datsun fell asleep watching fear factor and scare tactics too close to the stairmaster poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it woke up shortly thereafter hungover no underwear grasping a bayer aspirin and dropped it air maxes in my closet preposterous nikes made out of ostrich and the cross stitching is a cross mixing of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin fin cotton dockers oshkoshes drop crotches swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas but it is like being overstaffed at a boxing gym with all these trainers but i do not have any boxers and i am standing here naked hangover still wasted like paper you write raps on obnoxious yo why does it always sound like i am grabbing my nostrils fuck that i will battle em all i will battle a mall ill stand there and yell that at a wall until the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects that i am battering all shatter and fall because i hear the track and i am starting to get fucking amped i am a spark plug i am like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back i am a duracell but i sure as hell got it backwards because yall get jumped and i will catch the battery charge but i got a hunch like your back when it is arching when i start attacking

mechanical arms that will jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor no emotion hence i guess this sick prick dies hard i got a magic johnson it is like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me if ronda rousey was on the couch with the condoms out holding a thousand magnums at once to pounce me i laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around and all i see is paulie malignaggi she slaughterhouse in a blouse and madonna with mud on her god dammit i am a misogynist i slap linda ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony just so happens she is fond of algae because now she faceplants on the concrete complete lack of responsibility half of you assholes ai not strong enough to pick up a spirit shit you

kendrick lamars control verse and perform fack in concert yo i put that shit on a greatest hits album now that was awesome it takes some massive balls to do some shit like that sometimes i have to ponder why people are like  i will stick around  and put up with my crap so long for what is the attraction mama is it the fact that i am a walking talking actual quadruple entendre or the pointy nose that is pointing at you mama who knows at this point it is always poking so naah still get along with this voice because that is the monster so dosido with the sociopath everyone who knows me knows
